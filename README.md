## HUNTER FOR A BLOOD DONOR (FINAL YEAR PROJECT)

There are numerous applications for finding blood donors and locating nearby blood banks. These applications, however, are not available in Malaysia. The majority of them can be found in other countries. For example, there are some blood donor finder applications, such as Blood by Red Cross, which allow the donor to book an appointment with blood banks and also find local blood donation centres quickly and easily. After conducting research, it was discovered that there is no application available to locate blood donors in order to donate blood or to locate blood in an emergency while also tracking local blood banks in our country. This concept of integrating both inventions helps to tackle the problem of people looking for blood donors and nearby blood banks for the blood group they desire in the event of an accident. During an emergency, the application provides the benefits of saving time and life.
The Hunter For A Blood Donor Application, which is an application used by donors to make an appointment to donate blood.
